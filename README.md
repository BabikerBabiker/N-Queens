# N-Queens
 Given an n by n board, it returns all permutations of queens in a formation such that no queen is in the same row, column or diagonal.

 This project was made in my CSCI-3 Java class during Winter 2024. It solves a very trivial problem which most people should know.

 The motive behind this was to enhance my use of recursion, as I have only used it in the class preceeding it.
